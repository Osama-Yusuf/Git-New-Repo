### but for windows Git must be pre-installed, Or this script won't work. Open git bash termainl as adminstrator then

First copy it to the binaries folder to run it as a command without the extension (.sh)

### For linux use sudo:

```
sudo cp git_hub.sh /usr/bin/pusher
```

### For windows open git bash as admin and remove sudo:

```
 cp git_hub.sh /usr/bin/pusher
``` 

You can delete the script now if you want.

```
rm -f git_hub.sh
```

```
pusher
```
or
```
source git_hub.sh
```
